The most used method is a concrete slab foundation. It already saves on material as it will not need to carry as much load as heavy stonework or concrete buildings. For the customer, this therefore allows construction even in hard-to-reach places where construction machinery cannot reach. It is ideal for superstructure and extension projects where the original building would not be structurally able to cope with traditional construction systems such as masonry or concrete. The insulating core is strong and stable even after decades. It does not sag or become damp, which can be a common problem with conventional framed construction when poorly built. </p><p class="mb-4 text-slate-700 text-xl" data-v-0a5d69e5> The SIP panel technology also allows the building foundations to be made from panels. An alternative and unique solution for construction is foundations on screw piles.

The air in the building is therefore constantly fresh, preventing mould and dust allergens from spreading in the building. </p></div></div><div class="flex flex-col lg:flex-row-reverse align-center items-center pt-12" data-v-0a5d69e5><div class="w-full h-full lg:w-1/2 flex justify-center mb-12 lg:mb-0" data-v-0a5d69e5><i class="text-9xl text-emerald-500 fa-solid fa-wind" data-v-0a5d69e5></i></div><div class="w-full lg:w-1/2" data-v-0a5d69e5><h3 class="text-slate-700 text-2xl mb-4 text-emerald-500" data-v-0a5d69e5> HIGH STRENGTH </h3><p class="mb-4 text-slate-700 text-xl" data-v-0a5d69e5> Once the panel structure is constructed, the building system behaves as a monolithic shell, providing up to five times the structural performance of conventional timber frame construction. A building constructed with SIP panels has a sturdy and solid feel that is hard to distinguish from a traditional construction system once completed. </p></div></div><div class="flex flex-col lg:flex-row align-center items-center pt-12" data-v-0a5d69e5><div class="w-full h-full lg:w-1/2 flex justify-center mb-12 lg:mb-0" data-v-0a5d69e5><i class="text-9xl text-emerald-500 fa-solid fa-layer-group" data-v-0a5d69e5></i></div><div class="w-full lg:w-1/2" data-v-0a5d69e5><h3 class="text-slate-700 text-2xl mb-4 text-emerald-500" data-v-0a5d69e5> MORE USEFUL FLOOR AREA </h3><p class="mb-4 text-slate-700 text-xl" data-v-0a5d69e5> Buildings made of SIP panels provide 7-10% more usable floor space than traditional masonry buildings.
